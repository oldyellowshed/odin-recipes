    <h2>Banana bread</h2>
        <p>Banana bread is a moist, sweet loaf made from mashed ripe bananas, flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, and a leavening agent like baking soda or baking powder.</p>
        <p>The bananas give the bread a distinctively rich flavor, with a balance of sweetness and a subtle fruity tang. The texture is soft and tender, often with a slightly dense crumb.</p>
